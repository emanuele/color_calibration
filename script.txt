# How to profile a printer with a camera and a test chart.


# Take a printed (physical) test chart, for example:
GretagMacBeth i1_RGB_Scan_1.4 , sold with the I1 PRO

# Retrive the description of the test chart from Argyll distribution:
ref/i1_RGB_Scan_1.4.cht

# Retrieve the .cie file related to the target. The .cie file
# describes the test chart from the spectrophotometer point of
# view. So the .cie file is just the .ti3 file renamed, that can be
# measured with the spectrophotometer on the test chart with
# chartread. Note: for the test chart i1_RGB_Scan_1.4 the .cie file is
# not available so it must be read with chartread.
chartread -n i1_RGB_Scan_1.4
mv i1_RGB_Scan_1.4.ti3 i1_RGB_Scan_1.4.cie

# take a picture of the test chart in FULLY REPRODUCIBLE conditions
# (lights, camera settings etc.). If shooting RAW, postprocess with
# FULLY REPRODUCIBLE steps. At the end you obtain a .tif file. A 16bit
# TIFF file is more useful than an 8bit one, at this stage.
i1_RGB_Scan_1.4_camera.tif

# Read patches of the test chart from the .tif file
scanin -v i1_RGB_Scan_1.4_camera.tif i1_RGB_Scan_1.4.cht i1_RGB_Scan_1.4.cie

# The previous step results in a .ti3 file:
i1_RGB_Scan_1.4_camera.ti3

# Create an XYZ PCS LUT based profile for the camera:
colprof -v -D"<CAMERA MODEL>" -qh -u -ax i1_RGB_Scan_1.4_camera

# The previous step results in a .icc profile:
i1_RGB_Scan_1.4_camera.icc


# The quality of the profile in terms of DeltaE can be obtained with:
profcheck -v2 -k -w i1_RGB_Scan_1.4_camera.ti3 i1_RGB_Scan_1.4_camera.icc

# Check the last lines of the output of the previous step. Avg DeltaE
# should be lower than 2 and max DeltaE should be lower than 10. More
# or less :)

Now we proceed to calibrate the printer with the camera
#################################################################

# With the obtained profile, the camera is ready to be used for
# calibrating the printer.

# Generate the description of the target, for example:
targen -v -d2 -c vendor_profile/SP950PGPP.icm -G -e8 -g256 -f1300 i1proTarget

# create the tiff target with the additional flag -s in order to
# output also the .cht file necessary for the scanner/camera
printtarg -v -ii1 -L -R1 -m7 -M7 -t360 -P -p445x310 -s i1proTarget

# In the previous step you obtain two files: the .tif target and its
# description as .cht file to allow the automatic reading of the
# patches from the picture obtain with the camera in the next steps:
i1proTarget.tif
i1proTarget.cht

# print the target with the printer

# Take a picture of the printed target IN EXACTLY THE SAME conditions
# of the test chart above. If shooting RAW, postprocess with EXACTLY
# THE SAME steps used for the picture of the test chart. In the end
# you need to obtain a .tif file, preferably 16bit.
i1proTarget_camera.tif

# Read the patches of the obtained .tif, taking into account its .cht
# desciption and the camera profile:
scanin -v -c i1proTarget_camera.tif i1proTarget.cht i1_RGB_Scan_1.4_camera.icc i1proTarget

# The result of the previous step is the .ti3 file of the patches read
# from the target with the camera:
i1proTarget.ti3

# The profile of the printer can now be obtained with:
colprof -v -qh -r1.0 -S AdobeRGB.icc -cmt -dpp -A "<Printer Vendor>" -M "<Printer Model>" -D"<Printer name, paper, settings, etc.>" i1proTarget

# The quality of the profile in terms of DeltaE can be obtained with:
profcheck -v2 -k -w i1proTarget.ti3 i1proTarget.icc

# Check the last lines of the output of the previous step. Avg DeltaE
# should be lower than 2 and max DeltaE should be lower than 10. More
# or less :)
